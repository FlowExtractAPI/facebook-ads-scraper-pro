## 💎 Pricing Tiers - Choose Your Plan

The Actor automatically detects whether your Apify account is on a **free** or a **paid** plan — you don't configure anything. The plan decides two things: how many results a single run returns, and which proxy network the run uses.

| | **Free plan** | **Paid plan** |
|---|---|---|
| **Results per run** | **200 maximum** (a sample) | ♾️ Unlimited |
| **Proxy network** | Apify Proxy (shared residential pool) | Dedicated premium proxy |
| **Ad Library data & fields** | Full — nothing is stripped out | Full |
| **All filters & search modes** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Media assets (images & video)** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Best for** | Evaluating the output before you commit | Production, agencies, large datasets |

---

### **FREE PLAN** ✅ — try before you subscribe
Get started with no upfront cost. You get the **complete data shape**, just not the complete dataset.

**Included:**
- ✅ Full access to Facebook Ad Library data — every field, nothing redacted
- ✅ Multi-language & multi-country filtering
- ✅ Real-time batch pushing (results appear as they're collected)
- ✅ Complete media asset extraction (images & videos)
- ✅ All filtering options (date ranges, platforms, categories)

**Limits:**
- 🔒 **200 results per run — a hard cap**, counted across the *whole run*, not per query.
  A free run asking for 5 keywords × 100 results still stops at 200 results in total.
  The run then finishes normally (`SUCCEEDED`) — a short result set is the cap, not a failure.
- ⚠️ Apify Proxy (shared residential pool) only — the dedicated premium proxy is a paid-plan benefit
- ⚠️ Occasional connection interruptions on the shared pool

**Think of a free run as a free sample.** Run your real query, inspect the fields, check the ad
creatives and the EU reach data, confirm it fits your pipeline — then subscribe and re-run the
exact same input to get everything.

👉 **[Subscribe to a paid Apify plan](https://console.apify.com/billing/subscription)** to remove the 200-result cap.

### **PAID PLAN** ⭐ *RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION*
Upgrade for **unlimited results and enterprise-grade reliability**

**All Free Plan features PLUS:**

## 🔒 The Free-Plan 200-Result Cap, in Detail

**What it is:** a free-plan run pushes at most **200 results in total**, then stops cleanly.

**How it behaves:**

- The cap is **run-wide**, not per keyword, per URL or per advertiser. Five queries at
  `maxResultsPerQuery: 100` will not return 500 results on a free plan — they return 200.
- The run **still succeeds**. It is not an error, a crash, or a block.
- You are **never charged for results you don't receive** — the cap is applied before billing,
  so a capped run bills for exactly the results in your dataset.
- Once the cap is reached the Actor **stops fetching immediately** — it doesn't keep making
  requests for ads it can't give you.
- Every free run states the cap **twice**: once at the start of the log, and once in the
  finish summary and the run's status message.

**What you'll see in the log when a free run hits the cap:**

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 FREE PLAN SAMPLE — 200 of a possible unlimited results returned
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   This run stopped at the free-plan limit of 200 results.
   What you are looking at is a SAMPLE — the full result set is larger.

   👉 Subscribe to any paid Apify plan to unlock ALL results:
      https://console.apify.com/billing/subscription
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**And on the finished run header:**

```
✅ Sample complete: 200 results (free-plan limit of 200 per run reached).
   Subscribe to a paid Apify plan to unlock all results.
```

**To remove the cap:** [subscribe to any paid Apify plan](https://console.apify.com/billing/subscription)
and re-run the same input. Nothing in your Actor input changes — the Actor detects the upgrade
automatically on the next run.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run as Batch Job (One-Time Execution)

Perfect for: One-off scraping tasks, scheduled runs, offline processing

```bash
apify call dz-omar/facebook-ads-scraper-pro --input input.json
```

**Input format (input.json):**
```json
{
  "searchQueries": ["nike", "adidas"],
  "searchAdvertisers": ["15087023444"],
  "maxResultsPerQuery": 50,
  "countries": ["US"],
  "activeStatus": "ACTIVE",
  "mediaType": "IMAGE"
}
```

**Process Flow:**
1. Actor starts
2. Processes your request
3. Returns results
4. Actor stops

---

### Option 2: Run with Ad Library URLs (New in v0.2) 🔗

Perfect for: Copying searches directly from Facebook's Ad Library website, or fetching a specific ad by ID

```json
{
  "URLAds": [
    {
      "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=active&ad_type=all&country=US&q=nike&media_type=video"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=active&ad_type=all&country=ALL&q=adidas"
    }
  ],
  "maxResultsPerQuery": 50
}
```

**How URL Mode works:**
1. Go to [Facebook Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/) and set up your search
2. Copy the URL from your browser
3. Paste it into the `URLAds` field
4. All filters from the URL (country, language, date range, media type, platforms, sort order) are extracted automatically
5. The actor parses each URL and runs the search for you

**📌 Single ad links supported:**
URLs with `?id=` fetch that specific ad directly  no search query needed:
```json
{
  "URLAds": [
    { "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=907653308384731" }
  ],
  "enrichWithAdDetails": true
}
```

**Combining URL Mode with Manual Search:**

You can provide URLs alongside keyword and advertiser searches  all run sequentially:

```json
{
  "URLAds": [
    { "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=active&ad_type=all&country=ALL&q=pokemon&media_type=video" }
  ],
  "searchQueries": ["apify"],
  "searchAdvertisers": ["Nike", "15087023444"],
  "maxResultsPerQuery": 50,
  "activeStatus": "ALL",
  "adType": "ALL"
}
```

**Execution order:**
1. 🔗 All `URLAds` are processed first (each URL uses its own filters from the URL)
2. 🏢 Then `searchAdvertisers` are resolved and scraped (using the input schema filters)
3. 🔍 Then `searchQueries` are run as keyword searches (using the input schema filters)

`maxResultsPerQuery` controls the maximum ads collected per URL, per advertiser page, and per keyword query.

> 🔒 **On a free Apify plan, every run stops at 200 results in total** — across all URLs,
> advertisers and queries combined — no matter what `maxResultsPerQuery` is set to.
> That's your free sample. [Subscribe to a paid plan](https://console.apify.com/billing/subscription)
> to unlock the full result set with the same input.

<!-- ============================================================================
     STANDBY MODE — CURRENTLY DISABLED
     ============================================================================
     Standby mode (the always-on HTTP API server and its NDJSON streaming
     endpoints) is switched off for this Actor right now, so the sections below
     are commented out rather than deleted. The code is untouched — only this
     documentation is hidden. Uncomment this block (and the two other
     "STANDBY MODE — CURRENTLY DISABLED" blocks further down) if standby is
     ever re-enabled.
     ============================================================================

### Option 3: Run in Standby Mode (Recommended) ⭐

Perfect for: Real-time applications, multiple requests, APIs, instant responses

```bash
# Actor automatically runs in standby mode
# Access via: https://dz-omar--facebook-ads-scraper-pro.apify.actor
```

**Standby Mode Advantages:**

| Feature | Batch Mode | Standby Mode |
|---------|-----------|--------------| 
| **Cold Start** | 8-15 seconds | 0 seconds ⚡ |
| **Response Time** | Slow (start overhead) | Instant |
| **Best For** | Scheduled tasks | Real-time apps |
| **Concurrent Requests** | Sequential | Parallel ∞ |
| **Always Running** | No | Yes (pre-warmed) |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher (always on) |
| **Ideal Use** | Nightly scrapes | Live dashboards |

**Real-World Comparison:**

| Scenario | Batch Mode | Standby Mode |
|----------|-----------|--------------| 
| Track competitor ads daily | ✅ Good | ⭐ Excellent |
| Build a SaaS dashboard | ⚠️ Too slow | ✅ Perfect |
| One-time research project | ✅ Best | Overkill |
| API for other apps | ❌ Not viable | ✅ Ideal |
| Monitor 50 keywords live | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

**Example: Why Standby Mode is Better for Real-Time Dashboards**

Imagine you're building a competitor monitoring dashboard that updates live:

**Without Standby (Batch Mode):**
```
User clicks "Refresh"
  ↓
Wait 10 seconds for cold start
  ↓
Wait 30 seconds for results
  ↓
40 seconds total ❌ (User closes browser)
```

**With Standby Mode:**
```
User clicks "Refresh"
  ↓
Results instantly (pre-warmed)
  ↓
2 seconds total ✅ (User stays engaged)
```

## 🎯 Search Modes Explained

### 1. URL Mode (New in v0.2) 🔗
Paste Ad Library URLs directly  all filters are extracted automatically:
```json
{
  "URLAds": [
    { "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=active&ad_type=all&country=US&q=nike&media_type=video" }
  ],
  "maxResultsPerQuery": 100
}
```

**Use Case:** You've already set up the perfect search on Facebook's Ad Library website  just copy the URL and let the actor handle it.

**📌 Single ad links also supported:**

URLs containing `?id=` fetch that one specific ad directly  no search, no pagination:
```json
{
  "URLAds": [
    { "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=907653308384731" }
  ]
}
```

Pair it with `enrichWithAdDetails: true` to get the full advertiser, targeting, and payer/beneficiary data for that ad:
```json
{
  "URLAds": [
    { "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=907653308384731" }
  ],
  "enrichWithAdDetails": true
}
```

### 2. Keyword Search
Search for ads by keywords or brand names:
```json
{
  "searchQueries": ["nike", "adidas"],
  "maxResultsPerQuery": 100
}
```

**Use Case:** Find all ads mentioning your keywords across all advertisers

> **⚠️ Important  Keyword Search is Broad by Design**
>
> When using `searchQueries`, Facebook Ads Scraper Pro performs a **keyword search across all advertisers**. This means it matches any ad whose text, title, or page name contains your keyword  not just the brand you may have in mind.
>
> For example:
> ```json
> {
>   "searchQueries": ["SHEIN"]
> }
> ```
> This will return ads from **SHEIN Brasil**, **SHEIN KIDS**, **SHEIN Mexico**, and any other page or ad copy containing the word "SHEIN". The impression-based ranking may also surface different ads than you'd expect when targeting a specific page.
>
> **If you want precise, targeted results for a specific advertiser, use one of these instead:**
> - 🏢 **`searchAdvertisers`**  resolves the brand name to its exact Facebook page(s) and fetches only their ads:
>   ```json
>   { "searchAdvertisers": ["SHEIN"] }
>   ```
> - 🔗 **`URLAds`**  copy the URL directly from Facebook's Ad Library after setting up your exact search filters:
>   ```json
>   { "URLAds": [{ "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?q=SHEIN&country=ALL" }] }
>   ```

### 3. Advertiser Search
Search ads from specific Facebook pages:
```json
{
  "searchAdvertisers": ["Nike", "15087023444"],
  "maxResultsPerQuery": 100
}
```

**Use Case:** Monitor what a specific brand/company is advertising. Names are resolved via Facebook's typeahead API  all exact-match pages are scraped.

### 4. Combined Search
URLs, keywords, and advertisers all in one run:
```json
{
  "URLAds": [
    { "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?q=pokemon&country=ALL&media_type=video" }
  ],
  "searchQueries": ["marketing"],
  "searchAdvertisers": ["Nike", "Apple"],
  "maxResultsPerQuery": 50
}
```

**Use Case:** Run a comprehensive competitive analysis in a single actor run. URLs are processed first with their own filters, then advertisers and keywords run with the input schema filters.

     STANDBY MODE — CURRENTLY DISABLED
     ============================================================================
     Everything below until the END marker documents standby mode, which is
     switched off for this Actor. Kept here (commented, not deleted) so it can
     be restored verbatim if standby is re-enabled.
     ============================================================================

## 🔄 Standby Mode Deep Dive

### What is Standby Mode?

Standby Mode keeps the actor running 24/7 as an HTTP API server, ready to handle requests instantly without startup delays.

**Traditional Batch Mode:**
```
Request → Start Actor (8-15s) → Process → Stop Actor
```

**Standby Mode:**
```
Request → Instant Response (pre-warmed instance)
```

### Why Choose Standby Mode?

| Use Case | Batch Mode | Standby Mode |
|----------|-----------|--------------| 
| **Nightly automated scrape** | ✅ Best choice | Overkill |
| **Live competitor dashboard** | ❌ Too slow | ✅ Essential |
| **API for external apps** | ❌ Not viable | ✅ Perfect |
| **Real-time alerts** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Webhook integrations** | ❌ Doesn't work | ✅ Works great |
| **Mobile app backend** | ❌ No | ✅ Great |
| **Research project** | ✅ Good | Expensive |

### Technical Advantages

**Cold Start Elimination:**
- Batch: 10-15 seconds to start
- Standby: 0 seconds (instant)
- Difference: **10-15 seconds per request** saved

**Scalability:**
- Batch: One request at a time
- Standby: Handle 100+ concurrent requests
- Difference: **100x throughput**

**User Experience:**
- Batch: User waits for response
- Standby: Instant results
- Difference: **User stays engaged**

### Example: Competitor Monitoring Dashboard

**Scenario:** Build a live dashboard monitoring Nike, Adidas, and Puma ads

**With Batch Mode:**

```
Dashboard loads
  ↓
User clicks "Nike" tab
  ↓
API call to scraper
  ↓
Wait 10 seconds (cold start) ❌
  ↓
Wait 20 seconds (scraping) ❌
  ↓
Display results
  ↓
Total time: 30 seconds (user frustrated)
```

**With Standby Mode:**

```
Dashboard loads (scraper pre-warmed)
  ↓
User clicks "Nike" tab
  ↓
API call to scraper
  ↓
Results instantly ✅
  ↓
Display results
  ↓
Total time: 2 seconds (user delighted)
```

### How to Access Standby Mode

**Automatic Access:**
Simply use the actor URL directly:
```
https://dz-omar--facebook-ads-scraper-pro.apify.actor
```

**No Configuration Needed:**
- Instance is always running
- Ready 24/7
- No startup delay
- Just send HTTP requests

**Direct Integration Example:**

Your application can make direct API calls:
```
POST https://dz-omar--facebook-ads-scraper-pro.apify.actor
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "searchQueries": ["nike"],
  "maxResultsPerQuery": 50
}
```

### Standby Mode Pricing

- **Higher Cost:** Actor runs continuously
- **Break-even Point:** ~3-4 requests per day
- **Best For:** High-frequency usage patterns
- **Not Ideal For:** Low-frequency, scheduled tasks

**Cost Comparison (Example):**
```
100 daily requests
- Batch mode: 100 starts × 30 sec = 50 min/day = $$
- Standby mode: Always on = $ (often cheaper!)
```

### Standby Mode Limitations

- Maximum continuous run: ~30 minutes idle timeout
- Reconnect is automatic if disconnected
- Not suitable for very low-frequency usage
- Higher base cost even if no requests

### Standby Mode Best Practices

1. **Keep Connections Alive:** Send heartbeat requests periodically
2. **Handle Reconnections:** Implement retry logic on client side
3. **Batch Related Requests:** Send multiple queries in one request when possible
4. **Monitor Performance:** Track response times and errors
5. **Set Reasonable Limits:** Don't request 10,000 ads if you need 100

## ⚙️ Limits & Capacity

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Requests** | No hard limit, respects Facebook's rate limits |
| **Page size** | ~10 ads per request — a Facebook-side cap, not a setting |
| **Results per Query** | 1-10,000 ads per query |
| **Results per Run (free plan)** | **200 total** — a sample; subscribe to unlock all results |
| **Results per Run (paid plan)** | Unlimited — bounded only by your own `maxResultsPerQuery` and budget |
| **Delivery** | Real-time batch pushing — results appear in the dataset as they arrive |
| **Memory Usage** | No limits - handles 1000s of ads |

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Migration

### Automatic Retry Logic
- Failed queries are retried up to 3 times
- Exponential backoff prevents rate limiting
- Failed queries are logged but don't stop the job

### Migration Handling
Server automatically handles Apify platform migrations:
```json
{"type":"migrating","message":"Server is migrating to new instance","timestamp":"..."}
```

**Connection behavior:**
- Connection closes gracefully
- Reconnect to resume if interrupted
- No data loss - state is preserved

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **URL Mode Issues**
- **URL not recognized**: Make sure you're copying from `https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/...`
- **Filters not applied**: Check that the URL contains the expected query parameters
- **Wrong result count**: Use `maxResultsPerQuery` to control how many ads are fetched per URL

### **Search Issues**
- **No results**: Try broader keywords or check spelling
- **Limited data**: Increase `maxResultsPerQuery` or expand date ranges
- **Missing recent ads**: Facebook may have indexing delays

### **Free Plan Issues**
- **"I only got 200 results"**: That's the free-plan cap, not a bug — it applies to the whole
  run, not per query. [Subscribe to a paid plan](https://console.apify.com/billing/subscription)
  and re-run the same input to get everything. See *The Free-Plan 200-Result Cap, in Detail* above.
- **"The run finished early"**: Check the end of the log for the `🔒 FREE PLAN SAMPLE` banner —
  if it's there, the run stopped at the cap and completed successfully.
- **Intermittent failures**: Free runs use the shared Apify Proxy pool. Upgrading to a paid plan
  switches you to the dedicated premium proxy for stability.
- **Slow performance**: Reduce batch size or split into multiple smaller runs
- **Rate limiting errors**: Wait a few minutes before retrying, or upgrade to a paid plan

### **Geographic Filtering**
- **Empty countries String**: Use `"ALL"` for global targeting
- **Wrong country codes**: Use ISO 2-letter codes (US, not USA)
- **Missing regional ads**: Some ads may not be available in all regions

### **Media Access**
- **Missing media URLs**: Some ads may have expired media
- **Broken links**: Media URLs may expire after extended periods
- **Empty arrays**: Check if media type matches your filter

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Large datasets**: Use date ranges to limit scope
- **Free plan limits**: Free runs stop at 200 results in total — subscribe to a paid plan for 1000+ ads per query
- **Better results**: Upgrade to a paid plan for the dedicated proxy and enterprise-grade stability
